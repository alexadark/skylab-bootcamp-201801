#### *BRIEF*

*Bootcamp 3 weeks project using `react`, `nodejs` , `express` , `mongo` as technologies, agile as methodology.*
 
 *This Project show news from different sources( newspapers, tv news ) ordered by date , country, tag/term , ... fetching from remote API server and storing the 'liked' results to _`MONGO`_ DB as cache server to further reading. I think it's a interesting way to show the same world event from different sources at time , see the evolution of facts , the most liked notices, or even statistical purpouses. This is a private training webapp.*
